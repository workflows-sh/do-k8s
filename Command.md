# Deploy Infrastructure from IaC using CTO.ai

This repo includes a complete Digital Ocean infrastructure with Kubernetes, Container Registry, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Load Balancers and Project Resource Management all built using CDKTF & Terraform Cloud.

The repo also includes a PaaS workflow integration with CTO.ai that streamlines Developer Experience for utilizing the infrastructure, 
which includes interactive workflows that work in the CLI & Slack, but also full CI/CD & Preview Environments for all delivery.

## Pre-requisites
* Docker, Node (NVM) 12+ & npm installed
* Sign up for CTO.ai, setup CTO.ai team
* Install Ops CLI, Connect Github & Slack

Follow the CTO.ai [documentation](https://cto.ai/docs/gettingstarted) to get your environment ready for start using this workflows

## DigitalOcean Infrastructure
These workflows allows to manage Crystal Commerce Infrastructure over DigitalOcean, the resources that are defined for be managed are the following.
* Docker Registry
* Kubernetes Cluster
* MySQL Databases
* Postgres Databases
* Redis Databases
* Load balancers

You can add or remove resources changing the code of this repository or by editing the configuration parameters in your CTO.ai [team]().

## Commands
The following are the commands already implemented in this repository and are able to run from the **CLI** or **Slack**

### Sign In
In first place you need to sign in into the CTO.ai platform for that you can run in your **CLI** the following command.

```
ops account:signin
```
your browser goings to pops up asking for login credentials, once done you can go back to the **CLI**
```

This command is for destroy infrastructure or a service, you need to be **extremely careful** with this one.
```
ops run destroy
```
you going to get all the info about the destroy process, a the end a summary of the destroyed resources would be shown.

### Deploy
This command deploys a Service Docker Image into Kubernetes cluster applying all configurations defined for each service in CTO.ai [team]( ). it includes a certain number of replicas, a load balancer, health checks and set some environment variables. The parameters that are consider for this config are the following.

- **DO_DEV_SERVICES**: Services settings for **DEV** environment.
- **DO_STG_SERVICES**: Services settings for **STG** environment.
- **DO_PRD_SERVICES**: Services settings for **PRD** environment.

The command is the following.
```
ops run deploy
```
We going to be asked for which service we want to deploy (service are get from config)
```

then it ask again for the tag of the image that we want to deploy
```

✅ Deployed. Load Balancer may take some time to provision on your first deploy.
✅ View state in Terraform Cloud (https://app.terraform.io/app/cto-ai/workspaces/).

### Vault
This command allows to manage secrets in Kubernetes, these secrets are injected as environment variables to your pods in Kubernetes.

* **Init**<br>
This command option allows you to initialize the vault, and it should be executed when you create a new Kubernetes cluster.
```
ops run . vault init
``` 
* **Set**<br>
Set command option creates or update a new key/value pair in the vault
```
ops run . vault set
```
then you just need to provide the environment, key and value
```

This vault option destroys the vault from the Kubernetes cluster, so you need to be **extremely careful** with this, because after the deletion you going to lose all you key/value for the selected environment
```
ops run . vault destroy
```

## Service and Infrastructure Configuration
Most of the changes against infrastructure and services can be done without modify the code, just adjusting the parameters in CTO.ai [team]( ) config.Then you can re-run `ops run setup` for apply the changes in infrastructure and re-run `ops run deploy` for apply changes in services. 

## Kubernetes capacity setup
These parameters set the Kubernetes capacity cluster depending on the environment and taking this values from the `config` in the CTO's [team]( ). The definition of the size of the cluster is given in the following 3 `config` parameters:

- **DO_DEV_K8S_CONFIG** 
- **DO_STG_K8S_CONFIG**
- **DO_PRD_K8S_CONFIG**

One parameter for each environment, this config parameter is a string containing a `json` in the following format:

```
{ 
 "dropletSize": "s-1vcpu-2gb", 
 "nodeCount": 3, 
 “minNodes": 1, 
 "maxNodes": 5, 
 "autoScale": true 
}
```
### Redis, MySQL, Postgres Cluster Capacity/Scale Setup
The same approach can be used for other resources, like in this case a `Redis`, `MySQL` and `Postgres` clusters which is defined by the following parameters:

- **DO_DEV_REDIS_CONFIG** 
- **DO_STG_REDIS_CONFIG**
- **DO_PRD_REDIS_CONFIG**
- **DO_DEV_MYSQL_CONFIG** 
- **DO_STG_MYSQL_CONFIG**
- **DO_PRD_MYSQL_CONFIG**
- **DO_DEV_POSTGRES_CONFIG** 
- **DO_STG_POSTGRES_CONFIG**
- **DO_PRD_POSTGRES_CONFIG**

In this case the redis cluster config string has the following format.

```
[
  {
    "name": "my-service-api-redis",
    "dropletSize": "db-s-1vcpu-1gb",
    "nodeCount": 1,
    "version": "6"
  },
  {
    "name": "my-service-app-redis",
    "dropletSize": "db-s-1vcpu-1gb",
    "nodeCount": 1,
    "version": "6"
  }
]
```
The same approach is used for MySQL and Postgres
```
[
  {
    "name": "my-service-api-db",
    "dropletSize": "db-s-1vcpu-1gb",
    "nodeCount": 1,
    "version": "8",
    "db_user": "my-service-api",
    "db_name": "dev-my-service-api-db",
    "auth": "mysql_native_password"
  },
  {
    "name": "my-service-app-db",
    "dropletSize": "db-s-1vcpu-1gb",
    "nodeCount": 1,
    "version": "8",
    "db_user": "my-service-app-db",
    "db_name": "dev-my-service-app-db",
    "auth": "mysql_native_password"
  }
]
```
### Services Parameters Definition
To setup multiple services in the same cluster, we store all the deployment parameters like port, replicas, etc. as `config` parameter in CTO.ai [team]( ), it would makes deployments easier. The variables as shown before would be by environment as follows.

- **DO_DEV_SERVICES** 
- **DO_STG_SERVICES**
- **DO_PRD_SERVICES**

It contains an array of services with parameters in `json` format.

```
{ 
	"sample-app": 
		{ 
			"replicas" : 2, 
			"ports" : [ { 
				"containerPort" : 3000 
			} ], 
			"lb_ports" : [ { 
				"protocol": "TCP", 
				"port": 3000, 
				"targetPort": 3000 
			} ], 
			"hc_port": 3000 
		 }
}
```
### Mapping vault secrets to environment variables in a pod
Since in many cases you have to deploy multiple services using the same vault, you can find cases in which a variable name is the same for different services and generates conflicts, in order to solve this issue you can use `map` parameter in the json string for services, this allows you to map this variables. following is the json for a sample service.

```
{ 
	"sample-expressjs": { 
				"replicas" : 2, 
				"ports" : [ { 
					"containerPort" : 3000 
					} ], 
				"lb_ports" : [ {
					 "protocol": "TCP", 
					"port": 3000, 
					"targetPort": 3000 
					} ], 
				"hc_port": 3000, 
				"sticky_sessions": "no",
				"map": { 
					"DB_HOST" : "SP_DB_HOST", 
					"DB_USER":"SP_DB_USER", 
					"DB_PASS":"SP_DB_PASS", 
					"DB_PORT":"SP_DB_PORT", 
					"DB_NAME":"SP_DB_NAME"
				}
	 } 
}
```
each pair maps **pod env variable** to **vault variable** so for example **DB_HOST** in the pod going to have the value of **SP_DB_HOST** from the vault.
