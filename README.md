## DigitalOcean Infrastructure

This repo includes the following resrouces:
* Docker Registry
* Kubernetes Cluster
* MySQL Databases
* Postgres Databases
* Redis Databases
* Load balancers

## Demo 

You can try run, configure, and deploy the DigitalOcean Kubernetes workflow directly on our [Platform](https://cto.ai/platform). kindly follow the steps below to get started ðŸš€

## Latest Version 

The DigitalOcean Kubernetes workflow is updated and running the latest version 

---

## Getting Started 

```
git clone https://github.com/workflows-sh/do-k8s-cdktf.git

cd do-k8s-cdktf
```

---

### Create Account 

Before you can deploy this Workflow, you need to [Setup your account on CTO.ai](https://cto.ai/docs/setup-flow)

### Create API keys on DigitalOcean


- [In your DigitalOcean account, create your API keys for your CTO.ai Workflow setup](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#create-api-keys)


---

### Create an Account on Terraform Cloud

- Sign up and log in to your account on [Terraform Cloud](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#create-account-on-terraform-cloud) and add your [**Tokens** to your account on CTO.ai](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#add-tokens-to-ctoai).

---

## Usage 

After creating your accounts on CTO.ai and Terraform Cloud, set up your Infrastructure. 

### Build Pipelines for your DigitalOcean Infrastructure

In your application directory, build your DigitalOcean workflow, the Docker image from your Dockerfile, and your `ops.yml` file located in the specified path you created in your source directory using the `ops build .` command.

- [Check out the documentation to learn more on building pipelines](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#build--digitalocean-workflow)
- 

### Setup DigitalOcean Kubernetes Infrastructure 

Next, set up your DigitalOcean Kubernetes infrastructure to build, and run your DOKS workflow using the `ops run .`  and select `setup kubernetes infrastructure on DigitalOcean` the command will provision your DigitalOcean stack using CDK and Terraform.

- [Check out the documentation to learn more](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#setup-digitalocean-infrastructure-workflow)


### View Configuration in Terraform Workspace

- Back in your Terraform Workspace you will see your [DigitalOcean workflow created in your Terraform workspace](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#view-configurations-in-terraform-workspace) As it is synchronizing the state to Terraform Cloud and your workflow grabs the output and synchronizes it in your developer control plane. 


### Run the Deploy Workflow

Next, deploy your changes to your environment using `ops run -b .`. This command will deploy your DigitalOcean Kubernetes CDKTF workflow to your managed Kubernetes environment on DigitalOcean where you'll be able to input your `environment name`, `application repo` and `branch`

- [Learn more about running the deploy workflow](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#run-the-deploy-workflow)


### View your Kubernetes Services 

Back in your service application, [you can view all running services and nodes using a Kubernetes tool like Lens](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#kubernetes-services-are-running)

---

### Destroy your Environment 

After configuring your DigitalOcean Kubernetes Workflow, you can destroy your environment and services that are running using the `ops run .` command and select `destroy an environment`

- [Learn more about destroying an environment](https://cto.ai/docs/digital-ocean#destroy-your-environment)
